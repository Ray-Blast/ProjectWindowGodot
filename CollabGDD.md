# IntroductionÂ 

## Game Summary Pitch

- A learning project focusing on the improvement of our skills by emulating a symphony of the night metroidvania gaming experience. This project will let us understand more regarding game design, dev, storytelling, and cooperation in a small team.
## Theme
  - Learning and collaboration
    - With out theme of this project being collaboration and learning a new engine, we're aspiring to develop a joint project by expanding our horizions, delving into our fields of known study and other fields of new horizions. 

## Inspiration

- Castlevania and Metroid
    - From these two games, we're taking the classic formula of the "2d Side scroller platformer" that these games established

- Dracula (Novel by Stroker in 1897)
    - Vampiric essence, but mostly the nature of the divine nature of Dracula and the supernatural elements of the world itself

## Player Experience
- The general player experience will have them traversing a 2d level where they'll be able to get health picks, temporary buffs, and more for an average playtime of around 1-1:30hrs
## Platform
- PC
- Web (attempt to)
## Development Software

- Godot
- Aseprite
- Adobe Suite
- Git

## Genre

- Metroidvania Side Scroller with lite-RPG elements

## Target Audience

# Concept

## Gameplay Overview

- The general gameplay will consist of the player traversing the hand-crafted 2d manor, where they'll fight against respawning enemiesk as they try to get to the end of the level. At the end of each level, they'll have the opportunity to go against a mini boss, until the last one where they'll go up against the BBEG.

- In this being a collaborative project, we're hoping to be able to learn something new and expand our portfolio.
