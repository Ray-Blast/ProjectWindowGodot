- Reece arrives to Yorwin Manor by carriage, and fights through various supernatural enemies until he reaches the gate leading into the Manor proper.

- Reece faces off against the sea witch Styx, who is working with Yorwin so that she may face Reece in combat. After defeating her, Reece enters the Manor proper.

- Reece fights through the Manor Interior until entering a ritual room housing the kidnapped residents of Venta. There he encounters a massive automaton known as Balor and defeats it by destroying its single eye. After freeing the villagers, Reece moves into the underground section of the Manor.

- Reece struggles through the Manor Basement until reaching a faux throne room housing Yorwin and fights him after a brief dialogue. After nearly killing the vampire, Yorwin transforms into a bat-like creature and is finally defeated by Reece.
