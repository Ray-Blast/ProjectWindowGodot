Welcome to the project! 

This is a collaboration project in which we, as a small team, work together towards a common goal of making a game!

## Getting started
---
### Obsidian
If this is your first time working in obsidian, no worries. [Looking at this site](https://help.obsidian.md/create-note) can give you a general rundown of how obsidian works. [At it's core, obsidian lets you link notes](https://help.obsidian.md/link-notes) together in a way that dynamic and expandable. It's like building our own wiki!

### Git
We'll be using Git as our main source of version control. You can [download git right here](https://git-scm.com/). Install it and just leave the defaults as is for now. You can find out more about git in our [[Version Control Quick Reference Guide]]. I recommend using PowerShell if possible; mainly due to the Linux command integration that it has. read more about [navigating the terminal here](https://gomakethings.com/navigating-the-file-system-with-terminal/).

### Godot
For our engine of choice, we'll be using Godot to make our game. You can download Godot [on their official website](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/) or [or through steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790/Godot_Engine/). For this project, we'll be using Godot 4.4.x builds and incorporating any bugfixes come out with. As of writing this, we're on Godot 4.4.1.

### GitHub Repo
Our project is currently being hosted on a GitHub repository. You can clone it from here:
https://github.com/Ray-Blast/ProjectWindowGodot
The project is set to public and should let you push commits to it (allegedly). If something is bugging out, let me know and I'll officially add you as a collaborator through GitHub's systems.

## Game Design
---
For questions regarding the game design of the project, please take a look at [[Project Window Game Design Document]]. This is a living document that will be expanded upon as we iterate and develop the game.  It should incorporate all of the thought processes when it comes to our game vision.
